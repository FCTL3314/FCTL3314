### 📃 About

Hi 👋, I’m Nikita, a backend engineer with over 3 years of experience working mainly with Go and Python.

I’ve built projects using both monoliths and microservices, focusing on making things work well and keeping the code clean and easy to maintain.

I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in cooperation!
