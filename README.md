### 📃 About

Hi 👋, I'm Nikita - An active Fullstack Developer / Project Manager.

My journey in development began in 2022, since then I have independently studied the necessary technologies and at the same time worked as a freelancer. In 2023, I managed to find a full-time job where I still work today.
